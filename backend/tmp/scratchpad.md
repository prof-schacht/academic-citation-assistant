# Zotero Sync Fix - Development Log

## Issue Description
When a user selects only collections (no groups) in Zotero sync, the system doesn't know which library to fetch from. Collections exist within specific libraries (either user library or groups), but the current implementation doesn't track this relationship.

## Timeline

### 2025-07-15 - Initial Analysis
- Identified the bug in `zotero_service.py` line 100-101: when no groups AND no collections are selected, it fetches from personal library
- The issue is that when ONLY collections are selected, nothing happens because the system doesn't know which library contains those collections
- Collections need to be stored with their library ID to enable proper fetching

## Solution Plan
1. Update the collection data model to include library ID
2. Modify `fetch_collections` to return collections with their library ID
3. Update sync logic to determine libraries from selected collections
4. Add progress tracking for sync operations
5. Test the implementation

## Next Steps
- [x] Update collection fetching to include library ID
- [x] Fix sync logic for collection-only selection
- [x] Add progress indicator
- [x] Test with real Zotero data

### 2025-07-15 - Implementation Complete
1. **Updated ZoteroService**: Modified `fetch_library_items` method to:
   - Support new collection format with library IDs: `[{key: "COLLECTION_KEY", libraryId: "users/12345"}]`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with old format: `["COLLECTION_KEY"]`
   - Properly determine which libraries to fetch from when collections are selected
   - Handle the case where only collections are selected (no groups)

2. **Added Progress Tracking**: 
   - Added `_sync_progress` state to track sync operations
   - Added `get_sync_progress()` and `_update_sync_progress()` methods
   - Updated `fetch_library_items` and `sync_library` to report progress
   - Added `/sync/progress` API endpoint

3. **Fixed Collection Sync Logic**:
   - Collections now properly map to their parent libraries
   - When only collections are selected, system fetches from the correct libraries
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing collection configurations

4. **Added Test Coverage**:
   - Created comprehensive test in `tests/test_zotero_collection_sync.py`
   - Tests new collection format parsing
   - Tests backward compatibility
   - Tests progress tracking
   - All tests pass successfully

## Implementation Details

### New Collection Format
```json
[
  {"key": "CPUVP4AQ", "libraryId": "users/12345"},
  {"key": "ABCD1234", "libraryId": "groups/67890"}
]
```

### Progress Tracking Structure
```json
{
  "status": "idle|starting|fetching|processing|completed",
  "current": 0,
  "total": 100,
  "message": "Status message",
  "libraries_processed": 0,
  "libraries_total": 0
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /zotero/sync/progress` - Get current sync progress
- Existing endpoints remain unchanged

## Testing Status
✅ Unit tests pass
✅ Collection parsing works correctly
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ Progress tracking functional
