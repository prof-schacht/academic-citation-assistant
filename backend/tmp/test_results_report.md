# Backend Test Results Report

## Test Execution Status

The backend tests for bulk delete and admin clean features could not be executed due to the following infrastructure requirements not being met:

1. **PostgreSQL Database**: Not running on localhost:5432
2. **Docker**: Docker daemon is not running
3. **Test Database**: `test_citation_db` needs to be created

## Test Analysis

### 1. Bulk Delete Tests (`test_bulk_delete.py`)

The test file contains 3 test cases:

#### `test_bulk_delete_documents`
- **Purpose**: Tests bulk deletion of multiple documents
- **Test Flow**:
  1. Creates a test user
  2. Creates 5 documents for the user
  3. Bulk deletes the first 3 documents
  4. Verifies that exactly 3 documents were deleted
  5. Verifies that only 2 documents remain

#### `test_bulk_delete_only_owned_documents`
- **Purpose**: Ensures users can only delete their own documents
- **Test Flow**:
  1. Creates two test users
  2. Creates one document for each user
  3. Attempts to bulk delete both documents as user1
  4. Verifies that only user1's document was deleted
  5. Verifies that user2's document still exists

#### `test_bulk_delete_empty_list`
- **Purpose**: Tests bulk delete with an empty document list
- **Test Flow**:
  1. Creates a test user
  2. Calls bulk delete with an empty list
  3. Verifies that 0 documents were deleted

### 2. Admin Clean Tests (`test_admin_clean.py`)

The test file contains 2 test cases:

#### `test_clean_all_documents`
- **Purpose**: Tests the admin feature to clean all documents from the database
- **Test Flow**:
  1. Creates 2 users
  2. Creates 3 documents each for both users (6 total)
  3. Creates associated papers and libraries
  4. Verifies initial counts
  5. Calls `AdminService.clean_all_documents()`
  6. Verifies that all 6 documents were deleted
  7. Verifies that users, papers, and libraries are preserved

#### `test_clean_documents_with_citations`
- **Purpose**: Tests that cleaning documents also cleans related citations
- **Test Flow**:
  1. Creates a test user
  2. Creates a document with citations
  3. Calls the clean operation
  4. Verifies that the document and its citations were deleted

## Implementation Details

### DocumentService.bulk_delete_documents
- Accepts a list of document IDs and a user ID
- Only deletes documents owned by the specified user
- Returns the count of successfully deleted documents
- Uses SQL `IN` clause for efficient bulk deletion

### AdminService.clean_all_documents
- Deletes ALL documents from the database
- Cascading deletes remove related citations and document_papers
- Preserves users, papers, and libraries
- Logs the operation with counts in the system_log table
- Returns a dictionary with deletion counts

## Test Infrastructure Requirements

To run these tests successfully, you need:

1. **Start Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Start Docker Desktop or Docker daemon
   ```

2. **Start the database services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres redis
   ```

3. **Create the test database**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it academic-citation-assistant-postgres-1 psql -U citation_user -c "CREATE DATABASE test_citation_db;"
   ```

4. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv run pytest tests/test_bulk_delete.py tests/test_admin_clean.py -v
   ```

## Security Considerations

1. **Bulk Delete**: Properly validates ownership before deletion
2. **Admin Clean**: Should be restricted to admin users only (authentication required)
3. **Cascading Deletes**: Ensures data integrity by removing orphaned records

## Recommendations

1. Add more edge case tests:
   - Test with non-existent document IDs
   - Test with mixed ownership scenarios
   - Test transaction rollback on errors

2. Add performance tests:
   - Test bulk delete with large numbers of documents
   - Monitor query performance

3. Add integration tests:
   - Test the full API endpoints with authentication
   - Test WebSocket notifications during bulk operations
