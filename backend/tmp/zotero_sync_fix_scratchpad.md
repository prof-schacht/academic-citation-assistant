# Zotero Sync Fix Development Log

## Issue: "0 papers synced" problem
Date: 2025-07-15

### Problem Analysis
1. The sync process returns 0 papers even when collections are selected
2. Timestamp filtering might be too restrictive  
3. Collection filtering logic needs improvement
4. Lack of comprehensive logging makes debugging difficult

### Solution Plan
1. Add `force_full_sync` parameter to bypass timestamp filtering
2. Improve collection handling logic with better library identification
3. Add comprehensive debug logging throughout sync process
4. Create test utilities to verify fixes

### Implementation Steps
1. âœ… Analyzed existing code structure
2. âœ… Modified ZoteroService to add force_full_sync and improve logging
3. âœ… Updated API endpoints to support force sync
4. âœ… Created comprehensive test suite
5. âœ… Added PDF processing improvements
6. ðŸ”„ Update documentation

### Changes Made
1. **ZoteroService improvements:**
   - Added `force_full_sync` parameter to bypass timestamp filtering
   - Enhanced logging throughout sync process
   - Improved collection handling for backward compatibility
   - Better library determination logic (fetches from all groups when needed)
   - Added processing status logging
   - Enhanced PDF processing with error handling

2. **API improvements:**
   - Added ZoteroSyncRequest model with force_full_sync option
   - Added debug endpoint for configuration inspection
   - Enhanced sync endpoint logging

3. **PDF Processing:**
   - Ensured all PDFs are processed for chunking and embeddings
   - Added reprocessing for papers with files but no processing
   - Better error handling and logging for processing failures
   - Added status reporting after sync

4. **Test Suite:**
   - `test_zotero_sync_fix.py` - Comprehensive sync testing
   - `test_zotero_collection_debug.py` - Collection-specific debugging
   - `test_pdf_processing.py` - PDF processing verification

### Files to modify:
- `app/services/zotero_service.py` - Main service improvements
- `app/api/zotero.py` - API endpoint updates
- `tests/test_zotero_sync_fix.py` - New comprehensive test file
