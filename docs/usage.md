## Real-time Citation Features

### How Citation Suggestions Work

1. **Text Analysis**: As you type, the system analyzes your current sentence and surrounding context
2. **Embedding Generation**: Your text is converted to a 384-dimensional vector using sentence-transformers
3. **Vector Search**: The system searches for similar paper chunks using pgvector's cosine similarity
4. **Ranking**: Results are ranked by multiple factors including relevance, quality, and recency
5. **Real-time Delivery**: Suggestions are delivered via WebSocket in under 1 second

### Performance Optimizations

- **Debouncing**: Requests are debounced by 500ms to avoid overwhelming the system
- **Caching**: Frequently requested embeddings are cached in memory
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests per minute per user
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
