# Usage Guide - Academic Citation Assistant

## Recent Updates (July 17, 2025)

### Bug Fix: Citation Auto-Save (v0.0.1) üîß
Fixed an issue where documents wouldn't auto-save after inserting citations:

#### Issue
- After inserting a citation using the citation panel, the document would not automatically save
- Users had to type additional text for the save to trigger
- This was due to programmatic citation insertion not triggering the onChange event

#### Solution
- Added manual save trigger after citation insertion
- Documents now save automatically 100ms after a citation is inserted
- Normal typing behavior and auto-save remain unchanged

## Recent Updates (July 15, 2025)

### Zotero Sync - Final Verification Complete ‚úÖ
- **All Systems Operational** - Comprehensive testing confirms sync is working correctly
  - **Papers Syncing**: ‚úÖ 47 papers successfully imported from 3 collections
  - **PDF Downloads**: ‚úÖ 44/47 papers (93.6%) have PDFs attached
  - **Progress Tracking**: ‚úÖ Real-time progress updates working throughout sync
  - **Collection Filtering**: ‚úÖ Correctly identifies and syncs only selected collections
  
- **Understanding Sync Messages** - "0 papers synced" doesn't mean failure
  - This message appears when all papers are already up-to-date
  - Papers sync incrementally - only new or updated papers are processed
  - Force full sync option available to re-sync all papers
  - Check database for actual paper count to verify successful sync

### Zotero Collection Format Fix - Latest Update
- **Old Format Collection Sync** - Fixed critical issue where collections saved in old format wouldn't sync
  - **Root Cause**: Collections saved as `["CPUVP4AQ", "7AZYIPWP"]` (just keys) instead of new format `[{key: "CPUVP4AQ", libraryId: "users/12345"}]`
  - **Solution**: System now automatically detects old format and searches all libraries to find where collections belong
  - **Migration**: Added `migrate_collection_format()` method to convert old format to new format
  - **Optimization**: Only fetches from libraries that contain selected collections, improving performance
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully tested with 47 papers from 3 collections

### Zotero Sync Timestamp Issue Fixed
- **0 Papers Returned Bug** - Fixed critical issue where sync returned 0 papers despite having papers available
  - **Root Cause**: Timestamp filtering logic used `last_sync` timestamp to filter items, but recent timestamps caused API to return 0 results
  - **Solution**: Clear `last_sync` timestamp to force full sync when needed
  - **Database Fix**: `UPDATE zotero_config SET last_sync = NULL` to reset sync state
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ 26 papers successfully synced from collection "CPUVP4AQ"
  - **PDFs**: ‚úÖ 25/26 papers have PDFs downloaded
  - **Embeddings**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Paper processing has transaction timing issues (known issue)

### Zotero Collection Sync Fixed
