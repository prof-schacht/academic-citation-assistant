## Getting Started with Academic Citation Assistant

### What is Academic Citation Assistant?

The Academic Citation Assistant is a revolutionary tool that helps researchers, students, and academics write better papers by providing intelligent, real-time citation recommendations. Think of it as having a knowledgeable research assistant who instantly suggests relevant papers as you write.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Citation Suggestions

As you type your paper, the system analyzes your text and suggests relevant academic papers that support your arguments. These suggestions appear in the right sidebar within 1-2 seconds.

### 2. Confidence Scoring

Each suggestion comes with a confidence score:
- üü¢ **Green (85-100%)**: Highly relevant - perfect match
- üü° **Yellow (70-85%)**: Good match - review before citing
- ‚ö™ **Gray (50-70%)**: Possibly relevant - careful review needed

### 3. Smart Context Understanding

Unlike keyword-based search, our system understands the meaning of your text. Writing about "neural networks" will find papers about deep learning, CNNs, and transformers - not just exact matches.
