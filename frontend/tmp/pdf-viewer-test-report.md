# PDF Viewer Feature Test Report

## Test Date: 2025-07-18

## Summary
The PDF viewer feature has been implemented in the frontend, but testing is currently blocked by backend connectivity issues.

## Test Results

### 1. **Application Status**
- ✅ Frontend application loads successfully on port 3001
- ✅ Version v0.2.0 is displayed correctly
- ❌ Backend API connection fails due to CORS policy (backend on port 8000, frontend on port 3001)

### 2. **Component Implementation**
- ✅ PdfViewer component exists at `/src/components/PdfViewer/PdfViewer.tsx`
- ✅ Component is properly imported in DocumentEditor page
- ✅ PDF viewer uses @react-pdf-viewer library (v3.12.0)
- ✅ Component includes proper loading states and error handling

### 3. **Feature Implementation**
Based on code analysis:

#### Three-Column Layout Logic
```typescript
// From DocumentEditor.tsx
<div className={showCitationPanel ? (showPdfViewer ? "flex-[2] min-w-[300px]" : "flex-[3] min-w-[400px]") + " overflow-hidden border-r border-gray-200" : "flex-1 overflow-hidden"}>
  {/* Editor column */}
</div>

{showCitationPanel && (
  <div className={showPdfViewer ? "flex-[1] min-w-[250px]" : "flex-[2] min-w-[300px]" + " bg-gray-50 overflow-hidden border-r border-gray-200"}>
    {/* Citations panel */}
  </div>
)}

{showPdfViewer && showCitationPanel && (
  <div className="flex-[2] min-w-[400px] overflow-hidden">
    <PdfViewer paper={selectedPaper} onClose={handleClosePdfViewer} />
  </div>
)}
```

The layout adjusts dynamically:
- **Two columns**: Editor (flex-[3]) + Citations (flex-[2])
- **Three columns**: Editor (flex-[2]) + Citations (flex-[1]) + PDF Viewer (flex-[2])

#### PDF Viewer Features
- ✅ Header with paper title, authors, and year
- ✅ Close button with X icon
- ✅ Loading spinner while fetching PDF
- ✅ Error handling with fallback to "View paper online" link
- ✅ Integration with pdfjs-dist for rendering
- ✅ Default layout plugin with thumbnails and bookmarks

### 4. **Console Errors**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/api/documents/' from origin 'http://localhost:3001' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

### 5. **Blocking Issues**
1. **Backend not running or misconfigured**: The backend API at port 8000 is not accessible
2. **CORS configuration**: Even if backend is running, CORS headers need to be configured to allow requests from port 3001
3. **Cannot test actual functionality**: Without backend data, we cannot:
   - Load documents
   - Get citation suggestions
   - Test the View Details button
   - Verify PDF loading

## Recommendations

### To properly test the PDF viewer feature:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Configure CORS for development**:
   - Ensure backend allows requests from `http://localhost:3001`
   - Or use a proxy configuration in Vite

3. **Create test data**:
   - Seed the database with sample documents
   - Ensure some papers have PDF URLs
   - Add citation suggestions to test documents

4. **Manual Testing Steps**:
   1. Open a document with existing content
   2. Ensure citations panel shows suggestions
   3. Click "View Details" on a citation
   4. Verify:
      - Three-column layout appears
      - Selected citation is highlighted
      - PDF loads or shows appropriate error
      - Close button returns to two-column layout

## Code Quality Assessment

The implementation appears well-structured with:
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Error boundaries and loading states
- ✅ Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Clean component separation
- ✅ Proper state management

## Conclusion

The PDF viewer feature is properly implemented in the frontend code but cannot be fully tested without a working backend connection. The three-column layout logic is in place and should work as expected once the backend connectivity issues are resolved.
