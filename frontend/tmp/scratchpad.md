# Development Scratchpad

## 2025-07-18 - PDF Viewer Testing

### Task
Test the new PDF viewer feature implementation in the frontend application.

### Steps Taken
1. Created Playwright tests to automate testing of the PDF viewer functionality
2. Discovered the application was failing to start on port 3000 due to import error with @react-pdf-viewer
3. Found that dev server was already running, restarted on port 3001
4. Application loads successfully but backend connection fails due to CORS

### Findings
- Frontend implementation is complete with three-column layout logic
- PdfViewer component properly handles loading states and errors
- Layout dynamically adjusts between 2 and 3 columns based on PDF viewer visibility
- Cannot fully test without backend running and configured for CORS

### Technical Details
- Using @react-pdf-viewer v3.12.0 with React 19
- Layout uses Flexbox with dynamic flex values
- PDF viewer includes header, close button, and error handling
- Integration with backend API for fetching PDF URLs

### Next Steps for Testing
1. Start backend server
2. Configure CORS to allow frontend port
3. Seed test data with papers that have PDFs
4. Test the complete flow from citation suggestion to PDF viewing

## 2025-07-18 - PDF Viewer Feature Complete

### Summary
Successfully implemented the PDF viewer feature for viewing citation details in a three-column layout.

### Implementation Details
1. **Backend Changes**:

4. **Version Update**:
   - Updated package.json to v0.2.1
   - Updated version.ts with new build number: 20250718-001-PDF-VIEWER

### Testing Status
- Frontend implementation verified through code analysis
- Playwright tests created but blocked by backend connectivity
