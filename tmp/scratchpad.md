### How to Test Current Implementation

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up
   
   # Or if you prefer npm scripts
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   - Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API at: http://localhost:8000
   - API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health check at: http://localhost:8000/api/health

2. **Without Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start PostgreSQL and Redis (must be installed)
   # Terminal 2: Backend
   cd backend
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python run.py
   
   # Terminal 3: Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ Fixed TailwindCSS v4 PostCSS error by downgrading to v3
- ✅ Fixed Docker Compose pgvector image (ankane/pgvector:14 → pgvector/pgvector:pg14)
- ✅ Removed deprecated 'version' attribute from docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Fixed frontend Docker: upgraded to Node.js 20 for Vite compatibility
- ✅ Fixed backend Docker: corrected dependency installation process
- ✅ Downgraded Vite from v7 to v5 for better stability
- ✅ Fixed Docker volume mounts to prevent node_modules conflicts
- ✅ Added .dockerignore files to optimize build context

### Testing Summary
- ✅ Backend runs successfully on port 8000
- ✅ Health endpoints working (/api/health/, /api/health/ready, /api/health/live)
- ✅ Frontend runs successfully on port 3000
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling working correctly

5. Editor integration (user interface)
6. Management features (enhancements)

### Current Status
- Backend runs successfully with health checks
- Frontend runs with TailwindCSS styling

- Database schema fully implemented and migrated

## 2025-07-14: Real-time Citation Engine Implementation (Issue #4)

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created WebSocket server infrastructure (`/ws/citations` endpoint)
- ✅ Implemented text analysis service for extracting context
- ✅ Created embedding service with sentence-transformers
- ✅ Implemented vector search service for pgvector queries
- ✅ Built ranking and confidence scoring algorithm
- ✅ Created WebSocket client for frontend
- ✅ Integrated citation suggestions with Lexical editor
- ✅ Updated CitationPanel to display real-time suggestions

### Backend Components Added
1. **WebSocket Handler** (`app/api/websocket.py`):
   - Real-time citation endpoint with rate limiting
   - Connection management for multiple users
   - Message handling for suggestion requests

2. **Text Analysis Service** (`app/services/text_analysis.py`):
   - Context extraction from editor content
   - Sentence tokenization using NLTK
   - Text preprocessing and change detection

3. **Embedding Service** (`app/services/embedding.py`):
   - Text embedding generation using sentence-transformers
   - In-memory LRU caching for performance
   - Async batch processing support

4. **Vector Search Service** (`app/services/vector_search.py`):
   - pgvector similarity search implementation
   - Multi-index search support (local + future external APIs)
   - Batch search capabilities

5. **Citation Engine** (`app/services/citation_engine.py`):
   - Main orchestration service
   - Confidence scoring algorithm
   - Ranking based on multiple factors:
     - Cosine similarity (40%)
     - Contextual relevance (25%)
     - Paper quality metrics (15%)
     - Recency bias (10%)
     - User preferences (10%)

### Frontend Components Added
1. **WebSocket Service** (`src/services/websocketService.ts`):
   - Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
   - Message queuing for offline handling
   - Connection status monitoring

2. **Citation Suggestion Plugin** (`src/components/Editor/plugins/CitationSuggestionPlugin.tsx`):
   - Lexical plugin for real-time suggestions
   - Debounced text analysis (500ms)
   - Context extraction from editor state

3. **Updated Components**:
   - Editor component now supports citation callbacks
   - CitationPanel displays real-time suggestions with confidence levels
   - Connection status indicator in UI

### Testing the Implementation
1. Start the backend with updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uv sync
   python run.py
   ```

2. The WebSocket endpoint is available at:
   - `ws://localhost:8000/ws/citations?user_id=<user_id>`

3. Frontend automatically connects when editor is loaded

### Known Limitations
- Redis caching not fully implemented yet
- External API integrations (Semantic Scholar, PubMed) pending
- Need to implement paper upload functionality first

## Testing the Full System (Citation Suggestions)

### Prerequisites
1. **Populate test data** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python scripts/populate_test_papers_v2.py
   ```
   This adds 10 academic papers with embeddings to the database.

2. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python run.py
   # Backend runs on http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start the frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   # Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Testing Citation Suggestions
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Create a new document or open an existing one
3. Check the browser console (F12) for WebSocket connection logs
4. Start typing about:
   - "transformer architectures"
   - "BERT language model"
   - "deep learning for NLP"
   - "attention mechanisms"
5. After typing ~10+ characters and pausing for 500ms, you should see:
   - Connection status indicator (green = connected)
   - Citation suggestions appearing in the right panel
   - Suggestions ranked by confidence (High/Medium/Low)

### Debugging Tips
- Check browser console for:
  - `[WebSocket] Connecting to: ws://localhost:8000/ws/citations?user_id=test-user`
  - `[CitationPlugin] WebSocket connected`
  - `[CitationPlugin] Requesting suggestions for: <your text>`
  - `[CitationPlugin] Received suggestions: <count>`
- Check backend logs for WebSocket connections and embedding generation
- Ensure both backend and frontend are running
- Make sure test data is populated (check with `python scripts/test_full_system.py`)

## Import Error Fixes (2025-07-14)

### Fixed EditorState Import Errors
The user reported: "SyntaxError: Importing binding name 'EditorState' is not found."

Fixed in two files:
1. **frontend/src/services/websocketService.ts** (line 5)
   - Changed: `import { EditorState } from 'lexical';`
   - To: `import type { EditorState } from 'lexical';`

2. **frontend/src/components/Editor/plugins/CitationSuggestionPlugin.tsx** (line 8)
   - Already fixed to: `import type { EditorState } from 'lexical';`

The issue was that EditorState is a TypeScript type, not a runtime value, so it needs to be imported as a type import.
