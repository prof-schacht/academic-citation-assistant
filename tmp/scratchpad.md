### Test Results Summary

✅ **Button Appearance**
- The "Open in Overleaf" button appears correctly in the document header
- Button styling: Green background (rgb(22, 163, 74)) with white text
- Button classes: `px-3 py-1.5 text-sm bg-green-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-green-700 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed flex items-center space-x-1`
- Button is positioned between the Export button and Hide Citations button

✅ **Console Output**

- Successfully shows export process:
  - "[Editor] Manual save triggered"
  - "[Editor] Immediate save requested"
  - "Document saved: {root: Object}"
  - "Document exported to Overleaf successfully"

✅ **Overleaf Navigation**
- Clicking the button successfully opens a new browser tab
- New tab navigates to `https://www.overleaf.com/docs`
- User is redirected to login page at `https://www.overleaf.com/login` (expected behavior when not logged in)
- No JavaScript errors on Overleaf side

❓ **File Transfer** 
- Cannot verify if files (main.tex and references.bib) are transferred without logging into Overleaf
- The API call appears successful based on console logs

### Screenshots Captured

4. `4-header-with-overleaf-button.png` - Close-up of header buttons
5. `5-overleaf-page.png` - Overleaf login page

### Recommendations for Complete Testing
To fully verify the integration:
1. Create an Overleaf account or use existing credentials
2. Log into Overleaf before clicking the button
3. Verify that both `main.tex` and `references.bib` files are created in the new project
4. Check that the bibliography reference in main.tex uses `\bibliography{references}`
5. Attempt to compile the document in Overleaf

### Technical Notes
- The integration uses Overleaf's `/docs` endpoint which automatically creates a new project
- The document content is properly saved before export
- The citation plugin continues to work during the export process
