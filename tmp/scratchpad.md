# Development Log

## 2025-07-13: Project Initialization

### Phase I Implementation Started
- Created project directory structure:
  - backend/ - FastAPI Python backend
  - frontend/ - React TypeScript frontend
  - tmp/ - Development tracking
  - tests/ - Test files
  - shared/ - Shared types/utilities
  - scripts/ - Build/deployment scripts

### Completed
- ✅ Initialized git branch: feature/phase-1-implementation
- ✅ Set up Python backend with uv and FastAPI
- ✅ Created core configuration module
- ✅ Implemented health check endpoints (/health, /health/ready, /health/live)
- ✅ Set up main FastAPI application with CORS

- ✅ Set up React frontend with Vite and TypeScript
- ✅ Configured TailwindCSS for styling
- ✅ Created Docker Compose configuration
- ✅ Added development Dockerfiles
- ✅ Created project-wide scripts in package.json

### Project Structure
```

├── backend/          # FastAPI Python backend
│   ├── app/         # Application code
│   ├── .env         # Environment variables
│   └── run.py       # Development server
├── frontend/        # React TypeScript frontend
│   ├── src/         # Source code
│   └── vite.config  # Vite configuration
├── docker-compose.yml
└── package.json     # Root scripts
```

### How to Test Current Implementation

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**:
   ```bash
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up
   
   # Or if you prefer npm scripts
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   - Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API at: http://localhost:8000
   - API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health check at: http://localhost:8000/api/health

2. **Without Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start PostgreSQL and Redis (must be installed)
   # Terminal 2: Backend
   cd backend
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python run.py
   
   # Terminal 3: Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ Fixed TailwindCSS v4 PostCSS error by downgrading to v3
- ✅ Fixed Docker Compose pgvector image (ankane/pgvector:14 → pgvector/pgvector:pg14)
- ✅ Removed deprecated 'version' attribute from docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Fixed frontend Docker: upgraded to Node.js 20 for Vite compatibility
- ✅ Fixed backend Docker: corrected dependency installation process
- ✅ Downgraded Vite from v7 to v5 for better stability
- ✅ Fixed Docker volume mounts to prevent node_modules conflicts
- ✅ Added .dockerignore files to optimize build context

### Testing Summary
- ✅ Backend runs successfully on port 8000
- ✅ Health endpoints working (/api/health/, /api/health/ready, /api/health/live)
- ✅ Frontend runs successfully on port 3000
- ✅ TailwindCSS styling working correctly

## Phase I Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Schema & Models (Issue #2) - HIGH PRIORITY
- User model with authentication fields
- Document model for storing user papers
- Paper model with pgvector field for embeddings
- Citation model for document-paper relationships
- Library model for user paper collections
- Set up Alembic for migrations

### 2. Core Editor Implementation (Issue #3) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Integrate Lexical editor in React frontend
- Create document creation/editing UI
- Implement auto-save functionality
- Build document CRUD API endpoints

### 3. Real-time Citation Engine (Issue #4) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Set up WebSocket connection (Socket.io)
- Implement text embedding with sentence-transformers
- Create vector similarity search with pgvector
- Build confidence scoring system

### 4. Document Management System (Issue #5) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Document list UI with search/filter
- Document sharing and permissions
- Export functionality

### 5. Paper Upload & Vectorization (Issue #6) - HIGH PRIORITY
- Drag-and-drop file upload UI
- PDF text extraction with PyPDF2
- Text chunking system
- Vectorization pipeline
- Duplicate detection

### Implementation Order:
1. Database models (foundation for everything)
2. Document CRUD (basic functionality)
3. Paper upload (populate the system)
4. Citation engine (core feature)
5. Editor integration (user interface)
6. Management features (enhancements)
